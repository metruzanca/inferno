# Personal FIFU Dashboard

## Why?
I was gonna make a spreadsheet for my FI-~~RE~~-FU (Financial Independence, ~~Retire Early~~, Fuck yoU) but on second though... Lets get some experience with some js chart packages and some practice with databases and backend nodejs. (Self-Hosted Locally)

## What? (Abstract and non-concrete atm)

Take bank statements from bofa / third party service and visualize / track / budget it.
